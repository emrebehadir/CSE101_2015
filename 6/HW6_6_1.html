<h1>John BARDEEN</h1>
<p>John Bardeen is a significant engineer, intventor and physicist for computer science.He invented transistor that uses instead of vacuum tubes in Bell Labs with Walter Brattain, William Shockley. As working at University of Illinois, he helped his doctoral students Nick Holonyak who invented LED. Besides of this contribution, John Bardeen lay the foundations of teory of superconductivity with Leon Cooper. Because of his contribution, he is the only having two physics nobel prize and on the list of 100 Most Influential Americans of the Century in 1990. <a href="#References">[3]</a><a href="#References">[10]</a></p>
   
<h4>Life and Education</h4>
<hr>   
<p>Bardeen was born in Madison, Wisconsin. He joined University High School at Madison.When he studied school, his mother died owing to cancer.Then by his mother died, he changed his school and attended Madison Central High School. Bardeen who has brilliant mind graduated early as compared with of the same age child. Because of he loves math, he entered electrical engineering at University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison and continued to study for master degree at same university.Bardeen worked some laboratories after the master degree. He went to the Princeton University for doctoral degree. Then he started to working at Bell Labs. In the meantime, transistor was invented by John Bardeen and his colleague. He left Bell Labs and started to teach students at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He died on January 30,1991 in Boston, Massachusetts.<a href="#References">[2]</a><a href="#References">[9]</a></p>

 John Bardeen has big contrubition on computer science and make a name of oneself his innnovation of trasistor and superconductivity works.Scientists have to do new devices instead of vacuum tubes because it have some problem like breakable and heating up Bell labs started to do new devices with William Shockley, Walter Brattain and John Bardeen .Shockley ,who is the leader of project, thought that the
semiconductor is suitable for that. They started to   find the best semiconductor for this job. After 2 years, Bardeen prove that the best semiconductor is germanium with his experiment. They tried their new transistor with germanium on the telephone. They obtained really good results for that but it displayed an unstable construction. Then Shockley continued his studies in his home. And also Bardeen and Brattin continued his studies and They executed to start the first point contact transistor. After these progresses, Shockley  joined the group again and they invented the first transistor in 1947.They got the nobel in 1956 with their contribution about transistors and semiconductors.  Besides of this contribution, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, John Bardeen lay the foundations of teory of superconductivity with Leon Cooper and helped his doctoral students Nick Holonyak who invented LED.  <a href="#References">[1]</a><a href="#References">[5]</a><a href="#References">[6]</a><a href="#References">[7]</a><a href="#References">[8]</a> </p>
